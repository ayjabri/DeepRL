I tried to mimic an old code I found online that uses LSTM layer in a convolutional network with multiple MaxPools.
The approach uses multiprocessing and unique environment wrapper with one observation (no Stacking)
Unfortunatly It didn't learn after hours of training

Not sure what I'm doing wrong'
